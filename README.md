# Fancy New

The `fancy_yew` library contains yew components and layouts.
It is designed to build the frame of a PWA (Progressive Web App).
Some of the components are a wrapper around chart.js and inputs for different datatypes you can bind to a StateHandle.
In addition to that it has a resource abstractions, wich can be used to easily load/reload/change/delete resources through REST calls.

## Usage

This library is not yet released to [crates.io](https://crates.io) therefore you have to clone and reference the source code directly.
An example that uses this library can be seen in the [money-app](https://github.com/xilefmusics/money-app/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml).
In the future this library will be properly released to crates.io.
